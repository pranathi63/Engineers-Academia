        The mission of Academic Sustainability Programs is to support and encourage interdisciplinary teaching and research programs that incorporate sustainability principles in all academic units on campus, and to enhance interaction between campus operations and academic activities in sustainability.

            Sustainability in engineering is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources sustainably, i.e., at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment, or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

            Sustainable design in engineering is a general term that covers multiple engineering disciplines including but not limited to electrical, mechanical, civil, structural, environmental and architectural engineering.

            The aim of sustainable design is to produce places, products and services in a way that reduces use of non-renewable resources, minimizes environmental impact, and relates people with the natural environment. Sustainable design is often viewed as a necessary tool for achieving sustainability.

            Sustainable design engineers incorporate environmental considerations into their designs, just as they factor in financial considerations; they continually refine their designs to minimize the use of materials, energy and labor. They are often called "Green" engineers because they design buildings that will fit harmoniously into the environment, with a minimal disruption or degradation of natural ecosystems.

            Many regard green design as the future of design because it reduces cost, energy consumption, materials consumption, and natural resource consumption. It also creates a healthier living environment.

            Green building design concerns itself with better ways to utilize insulation, glass, solar heat, recycled water, and recycled building materials. However, the sustainability design engineer is not only concerned with large building projects, such as building green buildings, but is also interested in how engineering design can help people reduce their personal use of materials and recycle those they do use.
